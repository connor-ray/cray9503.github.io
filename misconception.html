    <h1>Biggest misconceptions in the coffee world!</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Dark roast has more caffine.</li>
        <p>
          False! The lighter the roast the more caffine and flavor. Essentially the more you roast a bean the more it is being cooked therefore, killing off flavor and caffine.
        </p>
        <li>Coffee is made from beans.</li>
        <p>
          Yes, we may call them beans, but they are actually seeds from a fruit similar to a cherry.
        </p>
        <li>Espresso has more caffine than regular coffee.</li>
        <p>
           Espresso may be the most dense form of coffee. However, there is about 95-200mg of caffine in every standard cup of coffee (8oz). As opposed to 45-74mg of caffine in a standard shot (1oz)
