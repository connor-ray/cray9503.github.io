    <h1>Biggest misconceptions in the coffee world!</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Dark roast has more caffine.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
          False! The lighter the roast the more caffine and flavor.<br> Essentially the more you roast a bean the more it is being cooked therefore, killing off flavor and caffine.
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coffee is made from beans.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
          Yes, we may call them beans, but they are actually seeds from a fruit similar to a cherry.
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Espresso has more caffine than regular coffee.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
           Espresso may be the most dense form of coffee. However, there is about 95-200mg of caffine in every standard cup of coffee (8oz).<br> As opposed to 45-74mg of caffine in a standard shot (1oz)

      <p>Here is a little table to help you understnad the difference between light and dark roast.</p>
        <table border=1>
          <tr>
            <th>Roast</th>
            <th>Flavor</th>
            <th>Caffine</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Dark</td>
            <td>Large body, less acidic</td>
            <td>Lower caffine</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Light</td>
            <td>Sweeter, more acidic</td>
            <td>Higher caffine</td>
          </tr>
